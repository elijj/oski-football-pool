Hello Participants: 
 
Welcome to another, exciting, football season.  The fun begins Sept.18th. E-mail your picks for Week 3 by Wednesday, Sept. 17th, 12:00 midnight or earlier.
If you haven't sent me your check, please do so as soon as possible.

A spreadsheet has been custom made for you to use so please use the attached form which is uniquely yours (don’t modify) except to add your picks to send in each week. PLEASE put your picks directly onto this spreadsheet, rather than to copy and paste from some other worksheet. Email your spreadsheet as an attachment to me. I can then copy your picks (as is) directly to the summary sheet without having to make any individual adjustments. Don’t delete your picks from week to week. At the end of Week 18, all your picks from Week 3 thru Week 18 will be included on your form.
 
To begin, download the attached file to your football folder.  Save it to your computer, your Football 25 folder, or somewhere you will be able to find it each week.
 
Now, open it, and save it using the "save as" button in the File dropdown menu.  Important:  Please do NOT change the name on the file. 

Next, open the form. Then add your team names as you did previously.  For team names, please use the abbreviated names as given on the schedule.  Remember to SAVE it.
 
Finally, email the saved form back to me as an attachment. (To send an attachment: click on the Attach File button or paperclip. Select the file and double click or follow the prompts.)  If you need help with any of this, please let me know.  You can do a trial run.  Just type in "TRIAL” in the subject line, save, and send. Please do NOT send it as a word document or within the email.
 
Please use the same form each week.  Just add your picks for the current week to the same form (all of your weekly picks will be retained), and attach it to your email for that week.  If you have any questions, let me know.
 
Thanks for your cooperation.
 Good luck to all. -- Oski
